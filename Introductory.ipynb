As you will notice, you will be using 2 programming languages: JavaScript and Python. Don't worry if you do not have experience with them! In fact, you don't need any programming experience at all. Basic computational thinking (e.g. how *for* loops work, what a *function* is) is enough to go through the labs. We will always teach by example, and you can always go back and check an example we gave you to know how to code anything we ask. Moreover, you can always ask specific questions about programming to the dedicated TAs of the course.\n",

However, for **IP1** and **IP2**, we use a special kernel that allows us to have a notebook with multiple programming languages, the [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/) kernel.

    "\n",
    "Now: why do we need to make everything so complicated and use two different programming languages? We can assure you it's not only to annoy you, and not only because we like the challenge. The real reason is because Python and JavaScript excel at two very distinct tasks. On one hand, **Python** is a high-level language with many great and popular libraries to **apply image processing algorithms** and visualize images. On the other hand, **JavaScript** is a fairly low-level programming language, and it is great for **implementing image processing algrithms** by accessing each pixel in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this course is not only for you to understand how to apply the different image processing methods to images, for which we will mostly use Python, but you should also learn how methods work in detail, pixel by pixel, for which we will mostly use JavaScript. In the upcoming labs you will usually need to implement every method **once** in JavaScript to show that you really understand the concept, and then we will show you how to apply the same method in Python, using existing image processing libraries. Remember that you don't need to worry about not knowing any of the two languages! You will be provided with examples of everything that you need to do. Of course, you always have the option to contact your TAs or check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), where you can find the answers to thousands of previously asked questions.\n",

    "## <a name=\"2A\"></a> 2.A. Basic Python Coding\n",
    "Declaring a variable in python is very simple. We have three basic types of variables:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Numbers\n",
    "my_var = 2\n",
    "my_var = 5.2\n",
    "# Strings\n",
    "my_var = 'Either use single quotes'\n",
    "my_var = \"or use double quotes\"\n",
    "# Boolean\n",
    "my_var = True\n",
    "my_var = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every variable can hold every type of data, so we don't need to specify the type at initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have lists of several items:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "my_list = [2.5, 7, 3.3]\n",
    "# List of strings\n",
    "my_list = ['E.T.', 'phone', 'home']\n",
    "# List of booleans\n",
    "my_list = [True, True, False]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists are 0-indexed and can be accessed with square brackets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Set the 3rd element of my_list to 5\n",
    "my_list[2] = 5\n",
    "# Retrieve the 2nd element of my_list\n",
    "new_var = my_list[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly we can make tuples, which are just like lists, but their values cannot be modified after they have been initialized:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a tuple of three numbers\n",
    "my_var = (3, 8.6, 4)\n",
    "# Access to a tuple is similar to lists\n",
    "new_var = my_var[1]\n",
    "# But we cannot write to a tuple!\n",
    "```\n",
    "For numbers we have the following basic operators:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the two variables\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 2\n",
    "# Addition\n",
    "a + b\n",
    ">> 7\n",
    "# Subtraction\n",
    "a - b\n",
    ">> 3\n",
    "# Multiplication\n",
    "a * b\n",
    ">> 10\n",
    "# Division\n",
    "a / b\n",
    ">> 2.5\n",
    "# Integer division\n",
    "a // b\n",
    ">> 2\n",
    "# Modulo (remainder of integer division)\n",
    "a % b\n",
    ">> 1\n",
    "# Power\n",
    "a ** b\n",
    ">> 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can have conditional statements\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a < b:\n",
    "    print('a is smaller than b')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('a is bigger than b')\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Indentation is important in python. Writing a conditional statement, a loop, a function, etc., without an indent (`Tab`) raises an error.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following comparison operators:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<  # Smaller than\n",
    "<= # Smaller or equal\n",
    ">  # Bigger than\n",
    ">= # Bigger or equal\n",
    "== # Equal\n",
    "!= # Not equal\n",
    "```\n",
    "A `for` loop is declared as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Note: range(n) creates numbers from 0 to n-1\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    # Another for loop inside the for loop - we call this 'nested for loops'\n",
    "    for j in range(10):\n",
    "        # We can also have formatted strings indicated by a preceeding 'f', where the number j is inserted into the string\n",
    "        print(f'Loop iteration number {j}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly a `while` loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 10:\n",
    "    print(f'Loop iteration number {i}')\n",
    "    i = i + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "And finally, a function can be defined using the `def` keyword:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A function that adds two numbers and returns the result\n",
    "def addition(a, b):\n",
    "    # Add the numbers\n",
    "    result = a + b\n",
    "    # Return the result\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the function\n",
    "addition(5, 10)\n",
    ">> 15\n",

    "As you saw in [Section 2.A.a: NumPy](#2Aa), the main reason that Python is so powerful is because of its libraries. To ease image visualization and manipulation, we have developed a library containing an **IPLabViewer** class, which you will be using throughout the course. This section explains its functioning and shows some examples and use cases of the **IPLabViewer**. Before using the class, be sure to check the documentation. You can call `help(viewer)` or `viewer?` in a cell, but we recommend you to check its extensive [wiki](https://github.com/poldap/IPLABs2020/wiki/Python-IPLabViewer()-class). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we import the required libraries. For ease of use, in the labs throughout the course we will import it as `viewer`. Moreover, we also load some of the images that you will be using throughout this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPLabViewer runs without explicitly importing any external libraries (all are imported in the class' `.py` file). However, we will import the library Ipywidgets ([see documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to allow interactive visualization. You will even use it to add your own functions to the viewer's interface! \n",
    "\n",
    "The magic command `%matplotlib widget` configures Matplotlib to use the Ipywidgets library to render dynamic plots. It allows us, for example, to zoom into images (button with a small square), and allows for proper functioning of the widgets. The IPLabViewer class **should not** be used outside the dynamic environment of Matplotlib + Ipywidgets. \n",

Therefore, after you fully understand the nature of every algorithm, and have the confidence that you can implement them yourself in JavaScript, the labs will always move towards trustworthy implementations in current image processing libraries. There are many libraries available, but throughout this course we will focus on three of the most common:\n",

The fact that it supports several programming laguages (`C++`, `Python`, `Java` and `Matlab`), and that it has over 20 years of history explains the huge community of users. Thus, there is also extensive documentation and tutorials, not only in its official website, but also on several other sites.  \n",
    "* [**`scipy.ndimage`**](https://www.scipy.org/) SciPy stands stands for Scientific Python, and it is one of the most widely used Python libraries (their packages include `NumPy` and `matplotlib`, which are considered standards in Python). As OpenCV, it is open-source and it has a huge community, as well as extensive documentation and tutorials. It has a myriad of applications for scientific and technical computing. In the IP courses we will focus on their module built for [Multi-dimensional Image Processing (`ndimage`)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html).\n",
    "* [**`scikit-image`**](https://scikit-image.org/) Scikit stands for SciPy Toolkits. These toolkits are add-on packages for SciPy. They are developed and maintained individually. As SciPy, they are open-source projects. Some of these Scikits have become very well known, and have a large community of users and developers. Scikit-Image, is one of them, developed specifically for Image Processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many other very good libraries for Image Processing tasks, we will only use these three because their history and community ensure long-term support and extensive documentation and examples.
